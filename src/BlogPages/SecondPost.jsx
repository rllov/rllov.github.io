            I saw a comment on a post on r/WebDev that said...

            ‚ÄúA portfolio site should be clean and organized. But consider what
            you're worth as a developer. What should a company pay you to
            produce work? Let's say it's $100/hr. You have to realize every hour
            you're spending making a site beautiful, you're not making money.‚Äù

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            This comment made me stop and think about how I spend my time
            building portfolio projects. I realized that while visuals are
            important, companies pay us for the value we, the developers, bring
            to the table. Things like how well we solve problems, structure
            logic, and build features are what really matter.

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Moving forward, I‚Äôm shifting my focus from pixel-perfect portfolios
            to <strong>tangible problem-solving</strong>. Here‚Äôs my plan:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>
              <strong>Start with user needs, not UI:</strong>
              <span className="block text-gray-600 mt-1">
                Sketch workflows and API contracts first‚Äîonly *then* design
                interfaces.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build "minimum viable tools":</strong>
              <span className="block text-gray-600 mt-1">
                Create functional prototypes (e.g., a CLI tool or API wrapper)
                before adding aesthetics.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Practice resilience:</strong>
              <span className="block text-gray-600 mt-1">
                Harden projects with error states, loading spinners, and mock
                network delays.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Write to clarify thinking:</strong>
              <span className="block text-gray-600 mt-1">
                Publish short post-mortems for each project‚Äîwhat broke, and how
                I fixed it.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limit design time:</strong>
              <span className="block text-gray-600 mt-1">
                Use a timer (e.g., 2 hours max for styling) to avoid rabbit
                holes.
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            The goal? To <strong>ship faster</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>learn deeper</strong>‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what companies pay for.
